changes: 
  - tweak: "The Hierophant Club has received a number of changes. It is no longer able to attack at range or mine and instead has been given a 5-tile range instant teleport on a 15 second cooldown. It still retains the teleport beacon functionality."
  - tweak: "With so much bloat removed, the Hierophant Club has shrunk down to the size of an ordinary item and can now fit nicely in most backpacks."
